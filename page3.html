    <h2>Snowfall</h2>
    <img src="midnight.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphere—usually within clouds—and then fall, accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes. It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away.

    <h2>Rain</h2>

    <p>Rain is liquid precipitation: water falling from the sky. Raindrops fall to Earth when clouds become saturated, or filled, with water droplets. Millions of water droplets bump into each other as they gather in a cloud.

    <p>"Live in the sunshine, swim the sea, drink the wild air. " "To be happy, you must be your own sunshine." "There is nothing more beautiful than a rainbow, but it takes both rain and sunshine to make a rainbow." "A sunny disposition is worth more than a fortune."
